# Development Notes

The current system does not have speed or safety as its primary purpose. Please do not use this system in a production environment. If you have related bugs or optimization suggestions, please submit an issue.

In the next step, instead of focusing on the development of new modules, the existing modules will be transformed and optimized.

Increase the linkage within each module.


### Ignore PHP version check
```shell
composer install --ignore-platform-reqs
```
